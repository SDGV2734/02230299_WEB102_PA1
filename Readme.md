# My Blog Post Management Server is a software that manages and organizes my blog posts.
  
I have created this elementary Node. js HTTP server is the best option to handle my blog posts. It has been specially created to deal with simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on blog posts which are stored in a local JSON file. The server hears the HTTP requests and then refines according to that, thus, I am able to interact with my blog posts by the help of the HTTP interfaces or other HTTP clients.
  
## What I Built
 
- CRUD Operations: Introduced features that enable one to make, read, update, and delete blog posts.
 
- JSON Storage: I chose to keep blogs in a local JSON file (`. /post. json`) for easy persistence.

- HTTP Methods: The Requests Methods (GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE) are the standard HTTP methods which are used for the operation requests.
 
## How to Get Started
 
To run this server locally, here's what you need to do:To run this server locally, here's what you need to do:

1. Verify that you have Node in your possession. JS is incorporated into your computer. The platform can be downloaded from [nodejs]. org](https://nodejs. org/).
  
2. Either clone this repository or get the project files and install them onto your machine.

3. Type the command - cd, then, the project directory.
 
4. Navigate to the package folder, run npm install to install the needed dependencies (`http`, fs, url).
 
## Running the Server
 
Once you've installed the dependencies, you can start the server by executing:Once you've installed the dependencies, you can start the server by executing:

The server will begin listening on the port that is defined in the script (the default is 3000). Through these tools such as Postman or cURL, you will be able to access the API endpoints.
 

### Available Endpoints
  
- Collect all posts (`GET /blog/posts`)
 
- Get Post By ID (`GET /blog/post/:It is ironic that even though the most popular art forms and music are the ones that are on digital platforms, most students tend to use cell phones rather than focus on the virtual platform.
 
- Design Post (`POST /blog/post`)
 
- Update Post (`PUT /blog/post/:CLI or PATCH /blog/post/:id`)
 
- Delete Post (`DELETE /blog/post/:for instance, interviewing your friends and family member(s) who`ve used oral contraceptives, referrals to reputable websites, etc.
 
Remember to replace :id  thereby notifies the actual ID of the post you wants to be retrieved, updated or deleted.
